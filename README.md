# Cubeventory!
 
A DnD5e inventory solution! Turn those abstract containers of infinite garbage into an active representation of what your lugging around on your adventures. Cubeventory is a helpful Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition tool to help track players inventory and encumberance without all the math that comes with it. The idea comes from [Zee Bashew's](https://www.youtube.com/embed/koKL1wSRLpk) video on the topic.
